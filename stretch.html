<center><h1>Mindful flexibility for the chronicallly inflexible</h1></center>
<center>By Steve Horne</center>
<center>Help editing by Wade Bittle</center>

<p>Welcome! This is the complete, clear, efficient, correct, organized, interesting, and hopefully timely guide to mindful flexibility. It aims to teach the inflexible person everything they need to know in the most skillful way to reach a strong, relaxed, and flexible range of motion in their body. This is called mindful flexibility for a reason. Mindful stretching aims to put you in touch with the physical feelings that arise to better put you into insightful mindfulness with your body. This aims to guide you to better listen to your body to give it the tender loving care it needs to be healthy.</p>

<h1 id="why-stretch">Why stretch</h1>
<ul>
<li>Stretching helps prevent every disease that is some how contributed by stress and inflammation. That includes heart disease, one of the major killers, and every itis that exists. It also includes a laundry list of mental illness from anxiety to depression to chronic fatigue. Stretching also helps the immune system as, stress impairs it.</li>
<li>Stretching helps heal chronic pain.</li>
<li>Stretching helps you feel more relaxed, more energetic. and more joyful in your body.</li>
<li>Stretching helps you better use your muscles to their fullest extent.</li>
<li>Stretching helps you gain better posture.</li>
<li>Stretching helps clear the awareness from the mental fog that chronically stressed people can experience.</li>
<li>Stretching helps with attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why wouldn&#39;t someone want to be flexible? Being inflexible can be a misery. A flexible man is full of life. Getting rid of built up tension and stress is the single biggest thing you can do for your health and quality of life!</p>
<p>There is currently a poverty of studies testing how stretching leads to better well-being and the prevention of disease. This may be due to improper stretching techniques and a general darkness in medicine of how stretching relates to mood, chronic pain, awareness, and general well-being. I would be the first to endorse an effort to provide scientific evidence and enlighten the medical community and the public at large about the importance of stretching throughout one&#39;s lifetime. This would be some of the most important work in preventitive and restorative medicine known to date. But who will fund something they can&#39;t sell? But you don&#39;t need to just take my word for it or find studies. There are countless studies showing the great benefit exercise has in health. And i will argue stretching is the best kind of exercise for well-being. Don&#39;t just take my word for it, though. If you are currently chronically tight and sore start practicing and over time the huge contrast between being chronically stressed and the way you feel when you are relaxed, strong, and flexible will be enough to make you realize it for yourself.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-stretch">How to stretch</h1>
<p>Stretching is meant to increases range of motion and reduce tension in the body so the tension relaxes and is released. </p>
<p>There are two muscles to keep in mind while doing this. The target nerves of a muscle are those that you wish to remove tension from. Tight hamstrings, stiff nerves at the front of the shoulder are examples. The opposing nerve fibers are connected to the opposite side. The whole trick for inflexible people to increase flexibility is to take all the forces off of the target nerve-muscle, while flexing the opposing nerve-muscles against a force so that the target nerve muscle expand and the opposing muscles build strength to reach ever deeper stretches. </p>
<center> <img src="howstretch.svg" alt="howstretch"> </center>

<p>One vital tidbit of wisdom is that when you contract a muscle it shortens, and pulls it toward itself. So in the image the opposing muscle is shorting and pulling it extending the muscle. So when the triceps contract it extends the arm and when the biceps contract it flexes the arm. If you understand this you will understand how to contract and build strength in any opposing muscle in your body. </p>
<p>There are two key forces to keep in mind when stretching--gravity and the normal force. Gravity is force that accelerates us downward towards the earth. The normal force is what pushes back when pushing against something. An example of the normal force is when push against a wall, and the wall pushes back. So for example sitting on the floor and bending forward will put a force downward on our leg, and the floor will push back contracting the hamstring. This is not what we want. We need to elevate the leg so the noraml force does not encourge the hamstring to contract so that it can relax.</p>
<p>Move into a position in the air where the forces are taken off the target muscle and contract the opposing muscle so that you feel a tightness in the target muscles. Hold that stretch as long as you can tolerate either the exertion or the feeling of tightness. Focus on letting the target muscle relax as you do this will contracting the opposing muscle. And then lay down and relax and be mindful of the feelings that come to the body. After resting, try again. Eventually the tightness or soreness will release somewhat, and when you rest you will feel sensations of relief and warm relaxation.</p>
<h1 id="where-to-stretch">Where to stretch</h1>
<p>A good place to stretch is a nice private space so that you can self place and be mindful without distraction. I like to stretch on my bed in my room because it gives me a nice comfortable mattress to rest on inbetween stretching.</p>
<h1 id="when-to-stretch">When to stretch</h1>
<p>If you stretch before a workout, there is a greater risk of injury, and you&#39;ll be too tired to work out. <!-- add source -->
If you stretch after a workout, you&#39;ll be too tired and warm and won&#39;t be able to tolerate stretching. If you&#39;ve ever tried to stretch when tired, this make the tension hard to tolerate, and you&#39;ll realize this for yourself. This prevents you from tolerating the continualy deep stretches you need to make progress.
So the best time to stretch is to stretch as a workout by itself.</p>
<h1 id="how-long-to-stretch-for">How long to stretch for</h1>
<p>This really depends on your tolerance level and energy you currently have. This may be as short as 3 to 5 seconds or as long as 20 or more seconds. Just hold it as long as you feel you are able to either until the tenseness releases or you tire out or are sick of the tension. Lay back and relax for awhile and notice as feelings arise and fall, and then when you are better composed have another go at it. Once you are tired, rest a day or two or four and then try again.</p>
<h1 id="hindrances-to-flexibility">Hindrances to flexibility</h1>
<p>How able you are to stretch depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How relaxed you are throughout your entire body</li>
<li>How strong you are in a given position; How long and deeply you can hold it</li>
<li>And how tolerant you are at any time determines </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relxation">Relxation</h2>
<p>One of the major hindrances to flexibility is how relaxed you are normally. I have had experiences where i was stretching out my torso and arms, and suddenly my legs relax, and i became more able to stretch them. So slowly building up strength and relaxation over time is a major contributer to getting those problem spots. This is also a MAJOR reason why stretching after working out is a poor idea. After working out your body will be tensed from contraction. This will prevent you from stretching and relaxing those problem spots.</p>
<h2 id="strength-and-endurance">Strength and Endurance</h2>
<p>Strength and endurance determines the ability to go deeply into a stretch and hold it. If you are not strong in a given position, it will be hard to hold a position long enough to release the tension.</p>
<h2 id="tolerance">Tolerance</h2>
<p>If you are tired and worn out, your tolerance of soreness, pain, and tightness goes down. This can be readily experienced if you&#39;ve been exhausted and then tried to stretch or got soreness or an injury. We are quicker to anger or feelings of hopelessness if we do not get good rest. This is why it&#39;s so important to stretch when you are well rested. Stretching is hard enough without being tired on top of it.</p>
<h2 id="keep-at-it">Keep at it</h2>
<p>You will notice improvements and sensations of relief every time you get a good stretch, but do not be discouraged if the tension doesn&#39;t release completely right away. It takes continual effort over many workouts to completely stretch out your body. If an area does not release in your workout, get a good rest, nourish your body, and try again another day. The next workout you will be stronger and more tolerant to be able to tackle your inflexibility some more.</p>
<h1 id="a-note-about-common-advice">A note about common advice</h1>
<p>There are many people who recommend stretches while putting a force on the target muscle. Stretches like this are touching your toes or doing a forward bend to stretch hamstrings. At best it is less effective. At worse they try to force it and it actually causes harm and damage. I will argue that this is a poor way to stretch because it encourages contraction of the target muscle. Some claim they work. This may be explained in people who already have strength in the opposing muscle, so that they are better able to stretch in such positions. But someone who does not have that strength will not easily be able to make the target muscle-nerves relax, and the target muscles will more easily contract against a force because the opposing muscle does not have strength to support it. It seems like becoming flexible is like a river with a bridge that is rarely crossed. Most people grow up and end up on one side or the other with very few people crossing the bridge. Stretching is taught by people on the other side of the bridge. They teach things that work for them because they are already strong and across, but they do not work for someone on the side of the highly inflexible. This leads to a mass of misinformation, so people continue to remain on either side with a bridge that is seldom crossed. There is also another set of advice which advises to stretch the opposing muscle to better improve the flexibility of the target muscle. This is confusing at best and misleading at worst. To gain lasting and deep flexibility the target muscle must be stretched through it&#39;s full range of motion. The only benefit in stretching the opposing muscle is making it more easily able to contract when you stretch the target muscle. But make no mistake the target muscle still must be put in a deep stretch to actually gain increased flexibility in it.</p>
<h1 id="the-states-and-feelings-of-the-body">The states and feelings of the body</h1>
<p>There are many states and feelings the body goes through. I have a lengthy personal experience with stretching from a very inflexible state so this was an opportunity to study them all in great depth. I have documented and collected from my experience what i believe to be all the sensations that one might notice as their body goes through different states and feelings, analyzed them, and grouped them into 6 major groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exertion to soreness and tightness</li>
<li>Exertion to release of soreness and tightness(Stretching)</li>
<li>Common states of exertion</li>
<li>Resting with soreness and tightness</li>
<li>Resting with release of soreness and tightness</li>
<li>Normal resting state</li>
</ul>
<p>with sensations of cool and warmth applied to each for a total of 12 categories.</p>
<p>The factors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contraction/Expansion, Exertion/Rest<ul>
<li>The three abilities of contraction<ul>
<li>Strength/Weakness(total mass)</li>
<li>Force(acceleration * mass)</li>
<li>Endurance(force * distance)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability of expansion/flexibility<ul>
<li>Strength in range of motion, fixed/unfixed pain and tightness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sensations<ul>
<li>Cool &amp; Warmth<ul>
<li>Temporary or fixed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pain, Soreness, and Tightness<ul>
<li>Temporary or fixed, Conscious/Unconscious</li>
<li>Infammation/Non-inflammation, Throbbing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tolerance/Intolerance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hypothesis of cause:
We feel tightness, soreness, and pain for four primary reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repetitive use</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Outside Force</li>
<li>Sickness</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exertion-to-soreness-and-tightness">Exertion to soreness and tightness</h2>
<p>Warm soreness:
Soreness, Fatigue, Stressed Joy
Hypothesis of cause for fixed:
As we use our muscles the nerves can get tired of firing which burns them out and are left in a chronically sore and contracted state. This leads to a state where the muscle is unable to recruit muscle to fire.</p>
<p>Cool tightness:
Tensing up, Tightness
Hypothesis of cause for fixed:
As we use our muscles, they tire and we relax, if the muscle that exerts tires and weakens to the point where it can not support itself, the opposite muscle tightens up to support it. Think of quadriceps fatiguing to the point where the hamstring muscle is forced to contract and tense up to support it.</p>
<h2 id="exertion-release-from-soreness-and-tightness">Exertion release from soreness and tightness</h2>
<p>Warm release:
Through stretching you will become conscious of soreness in the muscle. Then as you finish the stretch you will continue to feel the soreness but it will slowly relax and release to a warm comfort.</p>
<p>Cool release:
Through stretching you will become conscious of a high pitched tenseness. This is due to weakness in the opposing muscle. As you continue to grow stronger and release this, it will spread tranquility through your body, and as you rest after the strength you may feel sensations of warm tranquility to a cool breeze sensation.</p>
<h2 id="tolerance-and-intolerance-from-exertion">Tolerance and Intolerance from exertion</h2>
<p>Depending on how tired and warmed up you are from exerting yourself you will have varying degrees of tolerance. If you can not tolerate a stretch right now, rest up for a few days, and then try again. As we rest we cool down and gain more composure which helps our tolerance.</p>
<h2 id="common-states-of-exertion">Common states of exertion</h2>
<p>Warm:
As we exert ourself in weak muscles we may feel a red warm burn. We may also feel the same but with a higher pitch as we hold the muscle or for very weak muscles.
This is a common sensation when training.
Hypothesis of cause:
This is due to weakness in the muscle. As we remove weakness from the body, we will feel less of this.</p>
<p>Cool:
When we are in a normal state of exertion that we are very good at, we may not get very warm at all. We are strong and well adapted to the current exercise and at ease with it. It&#39;s good we are well trained but to remain in this state we are not pushing our boundaries or healing our body from previous exercise or weakness. Going for a stroll or holding easy postures are examples of this.</p>
<h2 id="resting-with-soreness-and-tightness">Resting with soreness and tightness</h2>
<p>Warm:
Soreness, nagging pain, screaming contraction
This occurs after a workout or when muscles tighten up again a bit after stretching.
As we relax, we become more conscious of the soreness built up. If there is fixed soreness or pain, it nags at us to do something about it. If we do nothing it may disappear and become unconscious but remain as a drain on the nervous system and a relaxed and clear state of mind.</p>
<p>Cool:
Mass of cool tightness
Sometimes you may feel a general tightness in an area. Some people report to feel a tightness in their forehead. For a long time i had a tightness in my right wrist. It just feels kind of tight and cool, like a dead mass. As we stretch and tranquility spreads to that area from an associated area, it gives way, and we may feel sensations of release in that area.</p>
<h2 id="conscious-or-unconscious">Conscious or unconscious</h2>
<p>As we rest, we may be conscious or unconscious of these states. If we have a lot of buildup of pain and tightness, we may just feel a general lack of energy and chronic fatigue. As we stretch, we become conscious of them and they are released. As we release more and relax, we are better able to concentrate and notice details in our awareness.</p>
<h2 id="resting-with-release-of-soreness-and-tightness">Resting with release of soreness and tightness</h2>
<p>These are all sensations that occur from an expansion of the nervous system.</p>
<p>Warm:
relaxed pain, fatigue
When we stretch or exercise, we can build up tears in muscles. We feel this as soreness. We wake up the next day and really feel it because we have relaxed and become conscious of it. Likewise, as we stretch, and nerves relax, we may become conscious of some pain that has remained in our nervous system we were previously unconscious about. A relaxed pain will surface which heals the injury. There may be some pulsing or throbbing associated with this, but it will feel not too bad. It feels somewhat like a semi-comfortable pain.</p>
<p>Warm spreading tranquility:
After we release a muscle from cool high pitched contraction, we may feel a warm tranquil state in the muscles and surrounding nerves. As we remove weakness from our body and get it to relax, other parts of our body relax. For example, as we release tension in our shoulders, nerves in other parts of our body also relax, from down our arms to sometimes all the way down to our legs. Likewise as tension is removed in our legs, this can spread tranquility up to higher parts of our body from our torso to our brain. This is a major factor in being able to reach deeper states of flexibility and relaxation throughout our body. This is also the feeling of joy. Also as tranquility spreads throughout our body, the sensation of a dull cool mass of tightness will decrease or give rise to a nagging soreness which gives us the ability to reach deeper problem spots in our flexibility.</p>
<p>Cool:
cool breeze
As we relax, we may feel sensations of coolness in the surrounding muscle. It feels exactly like cool wind across your face in cold weather, but you feel it inside your muscles. As i released tension in some parts of my body like my legs and my arms, i&#39;ve felt a rush of this all throughout my midsection and torso. This is certainly a strong feeling of relief.
Hypothesis of cause:
This may be due to a sudden decrease in the warmth of the nerve by supplying cool oxygen to it from having the nerve get in a less contracted state.</p>
<p>utter peace, deep freeze stillness
There is a deeper sensation that i have felt only recently that feels like a still cool water. It&#39;s a stronger feeling of coolness and stillness, and the word utter peace came to my mind as i was feeling it.</p>
<h2 id="normal-resting-state">Normal resting state</h2>
<p>Warm to Cool ratio:
Stress to Non-stressed ratio:
As we relax more and cool off, our normal resting state can have a varying degree of warmth to coolness to it. It&#39;s a warmth to coolness ratio. If there is no stress built up we may be in a constant state of tranquil joy. Likewise there are varying degrees of the coolness of joy. The cooler the joy the more associated it is with bliss. As time goes on we may become unconscious of stress in our body and not feel too well with flare ups of pain from time to time. And as stress goes to lack of stress we enter a state from discomfort and general malise to more comfort, energy, joy, tranquility, and cool peace. We could make a graph with two axis from warm to cool and non-stressed to stressed to pinpoint where we are at at any given time.</p>
<h2 id="other-feelings">Other feelings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pins and needles</li>
<li>Muscles falling asleep--numbness</li>
<li>Sharp pains. If you feel these at any time it&#39;s best to rest them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="healthy-vs-unhealthy-cycles">Healthy vs unhealthy cycles</h2>
<p>In an ideal healthy cycle we would go from exertion to rest with possible soreness and tightness to stretching to rest and release back to exertion again. In the real world this does not always happen. Some people exert and rest but never stretch, so they build up sore and tight muscles which can lead to associated diseases over time. Likewise some people exert themselves and try to stretch right after a workout. Since they are already in a contracted stressed state this does not give the tolerance nor the ability to relax into a deep stretch. Likewise, some people take time to relax, but they only go into a semi-deep stretch which leaves weakness and tightness in some muscles. Some people build up a lot of soreness and tightness in their body over time from not stretching, so they may have to go through a long period of stretching to rest to more stretching to come back into a state of health. As they stretch they will become more conscious of tension in their body and continue working on gaining back a good healthy full range of motion.</p>
<h1 id="the-basic-stretches-for-inflexible-people">The basic stretches for inflexible people</h1>
<p>It&#39;s important that you contract and hold these postures in the air. If we go into postures where a force is pressed in an awkward way before we develop basic flexibility, this may cause a bad pain due to not having the basic strength to hold them. Holding them only against gravity is the safest way we can stretch and develop a basic flexibility before we develop postures that require more strength.</p>
<h2 id="front-shoulders-and-arms">Front shoulders and arms</h2>
<p>Bend your torso over forward and stretch your arms far out to the sides. Experiment with reaching backwards and forwards and notice where there is feelings of high pitched tightness or soreness. Hold the position. Rest. Repeat until tired. Also experiment with internal and external rotation of the shoulder. Stand up straight and reach your arms out to the sides as much as possible. Rest and notice any sensations that arise and fall. Also extending your abdomen outward stretching your solar plexus while stretching your shoulders back can also provide a deeper stretch for inflexible people.</p>
<h2 id="back-shoulders-lats-and-inbetween-shoulder-blades">Back shoulders, lats, and inbetween shoulder blades</h2>
<p>Lay down or slightly tilted and reach out and up to the sides to stretch out inbetween your back and lats. Lay slightly tilted and stretch your shoulders up as much as possible while extending your arms up and to the sides. Also experiment with internal and external rotation of the shoulder.</p>
<h2 id="hamstrings">Hamstrings</h2>
<p>Seated Forward Bend(but with legs bent). Sit on the ground with your legs bent. Lower your torso to your flexing your quads and extending your foreleg up. You will feel a tightness in your hamstring. Hold and then release and relax. Your hamstrings insert on your hip bone, so leaning forward will effect the deepness of the stretch. Stretching out your hamstrings can also help loosen up your lower back and lower abdomen.</p>
<h2 id="leg-adductors">Leg adductors</h2>
<p>Lay on a bench or on the ground and raise your leg to the side contracting your hip muscles and stretching your Adductors.</p>
<h2 id="front-torso">Front torso</h2>
<p>Locust Pose. Lay on your stomach and flex your back expanding your front torso.
Stand up and stretch back to the right or the left.</p>
<p>If you feel pain in your lower back as you do these stretches, it may help to try releasing the hamstrings first so that it spreads relaxation to heal the lower back from pain.</p>
<h2 id="mid-back">Mid Back</h2>
<p>Lay on your back and do a crunch and tighten as much as possible while expanding the mid back.</p>
<h2 id="lower-back">Lower back</h2>
<p>Modified plow pose to target lower back. Lay on your back and then put your legs over your head and push against a wall so that your lower abdomen contracts and your lower back expands.
Boat pose. Raise your legs and torso in a V. If these are uncomfortable you could try to release your hamstrings and hips to first take some of the stress off that area.</p>
<h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2>
<p>Now that you know what to look for and how to stretch, you can experiment to get just the right posture for an inflexible muscle guided with feeling discomfort and slowly working to get it to release and relax.</p>
