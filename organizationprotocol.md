# Introduction

This guide is an attempt to create a method for shaping the future for the better through the individual efforts of people in one or more organizations.

What would it take for us to be able to shape the future? Just in general, if we had to reverse-engineer the process of changing the world through an organization, what would that look like?

# What are the functions of one or more organizations for social good?

What should an organization for social good do to achieve Its goals?

- We need to grow support for the organization by connecting people to other people, resources, and information about the organization and Its causes. This will help it grow.
- Develop the ability to easily startup and get good organizations going by training people, clarifying roles, and granting easy access to infrastructure. And we need to develop the ability to resolve conflict and shutdown bad and corrupt organizations and processes. This requires complete transparency. This will keep us functioning in good order and help make us resilient.
- Crowdsource and develop solutions for a specific cause.

# What is the feedback loop?

How do we learn from our mistakes to improve?

The feedback loop is when we set a goal, try something out, and gain feedback on how we could do it better that guides our future goals. Each of the functions of an organization listed above go through the feedback loop. This ensures we learn from our mistakes and get better as time goes by.

We need to
- Ask questions and gather data on how well our impact was for a function of the organization.
- Based on that data develop guidelines for goals set in the future.

# What are the steps to make this happen?

What does this process look like step by step? What does it look like when an individual wants to contribute?

- Step 1. Acquaint yourself with the organization.
> 1. Read the start guide and become familiar with the different aspects of the organization.
- Step 2. Research
> 2. Identify a function in the organization that needs improvement by looking at the state of the organization guide. If you don't know your cause and your role, read the gaining purpose guide to help brainstorm what you are meant to do.
- Step 3. Collaborate
> 3. Find people working on the same function or cause as you by finding people through the user guide. If no room exists for your cause, follow this guide to get one made for it.
> 4. See what is currently underway in our goal tracker.
> 5. Share your purpose and your intentions with the group in chat and in our goal tracker. See [How do i set SMART goals?](#how-do-i-set-smart-goals?)


<h1 id="how-do-i-set-smart-goals?">How do i set SMART goals?</h1>

SMART stands for (S)pecific, (M)easurable, (A)ction-able, (R)ealistic, and (T)imely. If we add a bit more detail to this we have a wonderful model for creating good collaborative goals that we can learn from. The SMART qualities are ordered and expanded in a sequence to be executed according to the feedback loop.

- Step 1. Research
> 1. Agreeable and Effective. Read the feedback guide detailing the feedback we've received so we know what has and hasn't worked in the past, and possibly an effective way forward. This will ensure you are building off a strong foundation.
> 2. If we are facing problems read the solution essays for the given problem to get insight and get acquainted with what we're dealing with. If none exists try researching into specific problems, the causes of the problems, the solutions put forward, and what it would look like if it were to be solved. Take the information you gathered and put it into a solution essay and post it to our site.
- Step 2. Lay out your goal
> 3. Make a goal up or select a task already made. Make it attainable, (R)ealistic, (S)pecific, meaningful and motivating goal. What exactly are you aiming for? Is it realistic and attainable? If your goal is a project, what are the milestones for your project? Can you set smaller goals? Is this goal meaningful to you? Is it in line with your purpose?
> 4. Consequences. What are the consequences of your goal? What will it allow us to do? Are there any bounties for your goal? What will happen if we don't achieve this goal?
> 5. (A)ctionable. What are some actions you can take now to further your goal?
> 6. What do you need from us to make your goal reality? Clarify this, and people interested in your goal will try to help!
- Step 3. Measure and adjust.
> 7. Select (M)easurable (T)imely criteria. What criteria would it look like to make progress in this goal? How long will it take? What questions do you need to ask to gather feedback and data to know how your progressing and what we need to adjust to maximize impact?
> 8. Gather feedback. Create a survey and announce it to us. From your feedback, what did you learn? How can you do better in future? Add to the feedback guide.
